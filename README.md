# Pandas-Matplotlib
Used the Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy Libraries in Python to create visualisation charts 

Explored various Matplotlib features to create data visualisations and draw insights from data using Fifa data and data of gas prices across Europe in the past few years.

Started by importing the necessary libraries 

Used a range of random numbers to create a line plot which was the first visualisation in this project 
Then used the gas data to create plots to tell the steady increase of gas prices in Canada, France and Italy over the years.

I then used pie-chart to draw relationships and tell stories using the Fifa data 

I also used bar chart, histogram and a stacked bar chart in this project.
